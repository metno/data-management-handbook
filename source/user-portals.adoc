== User Portals and Documentation

=== Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the human interfaces which data
consumers would use to navigate data and the related services. A portal is an
entry point for data consumers, enabling them to discover and search for
datasets and services while also providing sufficient documentation and guidance to
ensure that they can serve themselves using the interactive and machine
interfaces available.

Here, we can distinguish between a general portal that contains all publishable
datasets from the institution and targeted portals that offer a specific
selection of data, which may include external datasets. Targeted portals serve
specific user groups and may have a limited lifetime, but they can also be
long-term commitments.
