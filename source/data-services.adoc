== Data Services

=== Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to describe services that benefit from the
metadata standardisation efforts. The information structures
described in the previous chapter pave the way for efficient data discovery and
use through tools and automated services. Implementation of the services must
be consistent with the institute's delivery architecture.

Data services include:

1. Data ingestion, storing the data in the proper locations for long term preservation and sharing;
2. Data cataloguing, extracting the relevant information for proper discovery of the data;
3. Configuration of visualisation and data publication services (e.g., OGC WMS and OpeNDAP).
