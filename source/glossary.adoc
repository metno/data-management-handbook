|[[glossary-data-governance]]Data Governance
|Tech Target (https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-governance). An alternative definition by George Firican: “Data Governance is the discipline which provides all data management practices with the necessary foundation, strategy, and structure needed to ensure that data is managed as an asset and transformed into meaningful information.” (http://www.lightsondata.com/what-is-data-governance/ which also contains several more definitions.) 

|[[glossary-data-life-cycle-management]]Data life cycle management
|“Data life cycle management (DLM) is a policy-based approach to managing the flow of an information system's data throughout its life cycle: from creation and initial storage to the time when it becomes obsolete and is deleted.” Excerpt from https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/data-life-cycle-management[TechTarget] article.
Alias: life cycle management

|[[glossary-data-management-plan]]Data Management Plan
|“A data management plan (DMP) is a written document that describes the data you expect to acquire or generate during the course of a research project, how you will manage, describe, analyse, and store those data, and what mechanisms you will use at the end of your project to share and preserve your data.” https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-management-plans[Stanford Libraries]

|[[glossary-data-centre]]Data centre
|A combination of a (distributed) data repository and the data availability services and information about them (e.g., a metadata catalog). A data centre may include contributions from several other data centres.  

|[[glossary-data-management]]Data management
|How data sets are handled by the organisation through the entire value chain - include receiving, storing, metadata management and data retrieval.

|[[glossary-data-provenance]]Data provenance
|“The term ‘data provenance’ refers to a record trail that accounts for the origin of a piece of data (in a database, document or repository) together with an explanation of how and why it got to the present place.” (Gupta, 2009). See also https://www.theboohers.org/2015/03/03/provenance/[Boohers (2015)]

|[[glossary-data-repository]]Data repository
|A set of distributed components that will hold the data and ensure they can be queried and accessed according to agreed protocols. This component is also known as a Data Node.

|[[glossary-dataset]]Dataset
|A dataset is a pre-defined grouping or collection of related data for an intended use. Datasets may be categorised by:

_Source_, such as observations (in situ, remotely sensed) and numerical model projections and analyses;

_Processing level_, such as “raw data” (values measured by an instrument), calibrated data, quality-controlled data, derived parameters (preferably with error estimates), temporally and/or spatially aggregated variables;

_Data type_, including point data, sections and profiles, lines and polylines, polygons, gridded data, volume data, and time series (of  points, grids, etc.).

Data having all of the same characteristics in each category, but different independent variable ranges and/or responding to a specific need, are normally considered part of a single dataset.
In the context of data preservation a dataset consists of the data records and their associated knowledge (information, tools). In practice, our datasets should conform to the <<glossary-CMD-dataset,Unidata CDM dataset>> definition, as much as possible.


|[[glossary-dynamic-geodata]]Dynamic geodata
|Data describing geophysical processes which are continuously evolving over time. Typically these data are used for monitoring and prediction of the weather, sea, climate and environment. Dynamic geodata is weather, environment and climate-related data that changes in space and time and is thus descriptive of processes in nature. Examples are weather observations, weather forecasts, pollution (environmental toxins) in water, air and sea, information on the drift of cod eggs and salmon lice, water flow in rivers, driving conditions on the roads and the distribution of sea ice. Dynamic geodata provides important constraints for many decision-making processes and activities in society. 

|[[glossary-fair-principles]]FAIR principles
|The four foundational principles of good data management and stewardship: *F*indability, *A*ccessibility, *I*nteroperability and *R*eusability. Nature article [https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618[RD3]], https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/[FAIR Data Principles], https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics[FAIR metrics proposal], https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf[EU H2020 Guidelines]

|[[glossary-feature-type]]Feature type
|A categorisation of data according to how they are stored, for example, grid, time series, profile, etc. It has been formalised in the NetCDF/CF https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/data/formats/netcdf/v2.0/#templatesexamples[feature type table], which currently defines eight feature types.

|[[glossary-product]]Product
|"Product" is not a uniquely defined term among the various providers of dynamical geodata, either nationally or internationally. It is often used synonymously with "dataset." For the sake of clarity, "product" is not used in this handbook. The term "dataset" is adequate for our purpose. 

|[[glossary-semantic-web]]Semantic web
|“The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries". https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/[W3C] (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web[Wikipedia article])


|[[glossary-spatial-data-infrastructure]]Spatial Data Infrastructure
|"Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is defined as a framework of policies, institutional arrangements. technologies, data, and people that enables the sharing and effective usage of geographic information by standardising formats and protocols for access and interoperability." (Tonchovska et al, 2012). SDI has evolved from <<glossary-geographic-information-system,GIS>>. Among the largest implementations are: NSDI in the USA, INSPIRE in Europe and UNSDI as an effort by the United Nations. For areas in the Arctic, there is https://arctic-sdi.org/[arctic-sdi.org].

|A common approach to data management in a grouping of separate data management enterprises.


|[[glossary-webportal]]Web portal
|A central website where all users can search, browse, access, transform, display and download datasets irrespective of the data repository in which the data are held.

|[[glossary-webservice]]Web service
|Web services are used to communicate metadata, data and to offer processing services. Much effort has been put on standardisation of web services to ensure they are reusable in different contexts. In contrast to web applications, web services communicate with other programs, instead of interactively with users. (See https://techterms.com/definition/web_service[TechTerms article])

|[[glossary-workflow-management]]Workflow management
|Workflow management is the process of tracking data, software and other actions on data into a new form of the data. It is related to data provenance, but is usually used in the context of <<glossary-scientific-workflow-management-systems,workflow management systems>>.

|[[glossary-scientific-workflow-management-system]](Scientific) Workflow management systems
|A scientific workflow system is a specialised form of a workflow management system designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or workflow, in a scientific application. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_workflow_system[Wikipedia]) As of today, many different frameworks exist with their own proprietary languages, these might eventually get connected by using a https://www.commonwl.org/[common workflow definition language].

[[metadata]]
=== Metadata

Metadata is a broad concept. In our <<glossary-data-management,data management>> model the term "metadata" is used in several contexts, specifically the five categories that are briefly described in <<table-metadata>>. 

.Brief introduction to different types of metadata.

|Type
|Purpose
|Description
|Examples

|[[discovery-metadata]]Discovery metadata
|Used to find relevant data
|Discovery metadata are also called index metadata and are a digital version of the library index card. They describe who did what, where and when, how to access data and potential constraints on the data. They shall also link to further information on the data, such as <<site-metadata,site metadata>>.
|<<ISO-19115,ISO 19115>> +
<<gcmd,GCMD>>/<<dif,DIF>>

|[[use-metadata]]Use metadata
|Used to understand data found
|Use metadata describes the actual content of a <<glossary-dataset,dataset>> and how it is encoded. The purpose is to enable the user to understand the data without any further communication. They describe the content of variables using standardised vocabularies, units of variables, encoding of missing values, map projections, etc.
|<<cf,Climate and Forecast (CF) Convention>> +
<<bufr,BUFR>> +
<<grib,GRIB>>

|[[site-metadata]]Site metadata
|Used to understand data found
|Site metadata are used to describe the context of observational data. They describe the location of an observation, the instrumentation, procedures, etc. To a certain extent they overlap with <<discovery-metadata,discovery metadata>>, but also extend discovery metadata. Site metadata can be used for observation network design. Site metadata can be considered a type of <<use-metadata,use metadata>>.
|<<wigos,WIGOS>> +
<<ogc-om,OGC O&M>>

|[[configuration-metadata]]Configuration metadata
|Used to tune portal services for <<glossary-dataset,datasets>> intended for data consumers (e.g., WMS)
|Configuration metadata are used to improve the services offered through a portal to the user community. This can, e.g., be how to best visualise a <<glossary-product,product>>.
|

|[[system-metadata]]System metadata
|Used to understand the technical structure of the <<glossary-data-management,data management>> system and track changes in it 
|System metadata covers, e.g., technical details of the storage system, <<glossary-web-service,web services>>, their purpose and how they interact with other components of the <<glossary-data-management,data management>> system, available and consumed storage, number of users and other KPI elements etc.
