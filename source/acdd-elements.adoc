[[data-as-netcdf-cf]]
==== Creating NetCDF-CF files

By documenting and formatting your data using <<netcdf,NetCDF>> following the link:https://cfconventions.org/[CF conventions] and the link:https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3[Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD)], <<mmd,MMD>> files can be automatically generated from the <<netcdf,NetCDF>> files. The <<cf,CF conventions>> is a controlled vocabulary providing a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. The <<acdd,ACDD>> vocabulary describes attributes recommended for describing a <<netcdf,NetCDF>> dataset to data discovery systems. See, e.g., link:https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/[netCDF4-python docs], or link:http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/user-guide/io.html[xarray docs] for documentation about how to create netCDF files.

The ACDD recommendations should be followed in order to properly document your netCDF-CF files. The below tables summarize required and recommended ACDD and some additional attributes that are needed to properly populate a discovery metadata catalog which fulfills the requirements of international standards (e.g., GCMD/DIF, the INSPIRE and WMO profiles of ISO19115, etc.).

===== Notes 

*Keywords* describe the content of your dataset following a given vocabulary. You may use any vocabularies to define your keywords, but a link to the keyword definitions should be provided in the ``keywords_vocabulary`` attribute. This attribute provides information about the vocabulary defining the keywords used in the ``keywords`` attribute. Example:

[EXAMPLE]
====
:keywords_vocabulary = "GCMDSK:GCMD Science Keywords:https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/kms/concepts/concept_scheme/sciencekeywords, GEMET:INSPIRE Themes:http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme, NORTHEMES:GeoNorge Themes:https://register.geonorge.no/metadata-kodelister/nasjonal-temainndeling" ;
====

Note that the *GCMDSK*, *GEMET* and *NORTHEMES* vocabularies are required for indexing in https://adc.met.no/[S-ENDA] and https://www.geonorge.no/en/[Geonorge]. You may find appropriate keywords at the following links:

* https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/kms/concepts/concept_scheme/sciencekeywords[GCMDSK]
* http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme[GEMET]
* https://register.geonorge.no/metadata-kodelister/nasjonal-temainndeling[NORTHEMES]

The keywords should be provided by the ``keywords`` attribute as a comma separated list with a short name defining the vocabulary used, followed by the actual keyword, i.e., ``short_name:keyword``. Example:

[EXAMPLE]
====
:keywords = "GCMDSK:Earth Science > Atmosphere > Atmospheric radiation, GEMET:Meteorological geographical features, GEMET:Atmospheric conditions, NORTHEMES:Weather and climate" ;
====

See https://adc.met.no/node/96 for more information about how to define the ACDD keywords.

A data *license* provides information about any restrictions on the use of the dataset. To support a linked data approach, it is strongly recommended to use identifiers and URL's from https://spdx.org/licenses/ and to use a form similar to <URL>(<Identifier>) using elements from the SPDX license list. Example:

[EXAMPLE]
====
:license = "http://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0(CC-BY-4.0)" ;

[[acdd-elements]]
===== List of Attributes

This section provides lists of ACDD elements that are required and recommended, as well as some extra elements that are needed to fully support our data management needs. The right columns of these tables provide the https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/metno/mmd/blob/master/doc/mmd-specification.html[MET Norway Metadata Specification (MMD)] fields that map to the ACDD (and our extension to ACDD) elements. Please refer to https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/metno/mmd/blob/master/doc/mmd-specification.html[MMD] for definitions of these elements, as well as controlled vocabularies that should be used. Note that the below tables are automatically generated - check https://github.com/metno/py-mmd-tools/blob/master/py_mmd_tools/mmd_elements.yaml if anything is unclear.

In order to check your netCDF-CF files, and to create MMD xml files, you can use the nc2mmd.py script in the https://github.com/metno/py-mmd-tools[py-mmd-tools] Python package.

The following ACDD elements are required:
[cols="1,1,3"]
|=======================================================================
|*ACDD Attribute* |*MMD equivalent* |*Description*
|id |metadata_identifier |An identifier for the dataset, provided by and unique within its naming authority. The combination of the "naming authority" and the "id" should be globally unique, but the id can be globally unique by itself also. A uuid is recommended.
|naming_authority |metadata_identifier |The organization that provides the initial id (see above) for the dataset. The naming authority should be uniquely specified by this attribute. We recommend using reverse-DNS naming for the naming authority.
|Conventions |Conventions |A comma-separated string of the conventions that are followed by the dataset. For files that follow this version of ACDD, include the string 'ACDD-1.3' (this attribute is described in the NetCDF Users Guide.)
|history |history |Provides an audit trail for modifications to the original data. This attribute is also in the NetCDF Users Guide ('This is a character array with a line for each invocation of a program that has modified the dataset. Well-behaved generic netCDF applications should append a line containing date, time of day, user name, program name and command arguments'). To include a more complete description you can append a reference to an ISO Lineage entity; see NOAA EDM ISO Lineage guidance.
|date_created |last_metadata_update>update>datetime |The date on which this version of the data was created (modification of variable values implies a new version, hence this would be assigned the date of the most recent modification of variable values). Metadata changes are not considered when assigning the date_created. The ISO 8601:2004 extended date format is recommended, e.g., 2020-10-20T12:35:00Z.
|title |title>title |A short phrase or sentence describing the dataset. In many discovery systems, the title will be displayed in the results list from a search, and therefore should be human readable and reasonable to display in a list of such names. This attribute is also recommended by the NetCDF Users Guide and the CF conventions.
|summary |abstract>abstract |A paragraph describing the dataset, analogous to an abstract for a paper. Use ACDD extension "summary_no" for Norwegian translation.
|time_coverage_start |temporal_extent>start_date |Describes the time of the first data point in the data set. Use the ISO 8601:2004 date format, preferably the extended format as recommended in the Attribute Content Guidance section. I.e. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (always use UTC).
|geospatial_lat_max |geographic_extent>rectangle>north |Describes a simple upper latitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. Geospatial_lat_max specifies the northernmost latitude covered by the dataset. Must be decimal degrees north.
|geospatial_lat_min |geographic_extent>rectangle>south |Describes a simple lower latitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. Geospatial_lat_min specifies the southernmost latitude covered by the dataset. Must be decimal degrees north.
|geospatial_lon_max |geographic_extent>rectangle>east |Describes a simple longitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. geospatial_lon_max specifies the easternmost longitude covered by the dataset. Cases where geospatial_lon_min is greater than geospatial_lon_max indicate the bounding box extends from geospatial_lon_max, through the longitude range discontinuity meridian (either the antimeridian for -180:180 values, or Prime Meridian for 0:360 values), to geospatial_lon_min; for example, geospatial_lon_min=170 and geospatial_lon_max=-175 incorporates 15 degrees of longitude (ranges 170 to 180 and -180 to -175). Must be decimal degrees east (negative westwards).
|geospatial_lon_min |geographic_extent>rectangle>west |Describes a simple longitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. geospatial_lon_min specifies the westernmost longitude covered by the dataset. See also geospatial_lon_max. Must be decimal degrees east (negative westwards).
|license |use_constraint>resource |Provide the URL to a standard or specific license, enter "Freely Distributed" or "None", or describe any restrictions to data access and distribution in free text. It is strongly recommended to use identifiers and URL's from https://spdx.org/licenses/ and to use a form similar to <URL>(<Identifier>) using elements from the SPDX license list.
|keywords |keywords>keyword |A comma-separated list of keywords and/or phrases. Keywords may be common words or phrases, terms from a controlled vocabulary (GCMD is required), or URIs for terms from a controlled vocabulary (see also "keywords_vocabulary" attribute). If keywords are extracted from, e.g., GCMD Science Keywords, add keywords_vocabulary="GCMDSK" and prefix in any case each keyword with the appropriate prefix.
|keywords_vocabulary |keywords>vocabulary |If you are using a controlled vocabulary for the words/phrases in your "keywords" attribute, this is the unique name or identifier of the vocabulary from which keywords are taken. If more than one keyword vocabulary is used, each may be presented with a key, a long name, and a url, followed by a comma, so that keywords may be prefixed with the controlled vocabulary key. Example; 'GCMDSK:GCMD Science Keywords:https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/kms/concepts/concept_scheme/sciencekeywords, GEMET:INSPIRE Themes:http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme'.
|=======================================================================

The following ACDD elements are recommended (should be used if there is no good reason not to use it):
[cols="1,1,3"]
|=======================================================================
|*ACDD Attribute* |*MMD equivalent* |*Description*
|publisher_type | publisher_type | Specifies type of publisher as one of 'person', 'group', 'institution', or 'position'. If this attribute is not specified, the publisher is assumed to be a person.
|publisher_email | publisher_email | The email address of the person (or other entity specified by the publisher_type attribute) responsible for publishing the data file or product to users, with its current metadata and format.
|time_coverage_end | temporal_extent>end_date | Describes the time of the last data point in the data set. If the dataset is continuously updated with new measurements (e.g., a timeseries receiving new observations), this attribute can be omitted. Use ISO 8601:2004 date format, preferably the extended format as recommended in the Attribute Content Guidance section. I.e. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (always use UTC).
|geospatial_bounds | geographic_extent>polygon | Describes the data's 2D or 3D geospatial extent in OGC's Well-Known Text (WKT) Geometry format (reference the OGC Simple Feature Access (SFA) specification). The meaning and order of values for each point's coordinates depends on the coordinate reference system (CRS). The ACDD default is 2D geometry in the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system. The default may be overridden with geospatial_bounds_crs and geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs (see those attributes). EPSG:4326 coordinate values are latitude (decimal degrees_north) and longitude (decimal degrees_east), in that order. Longitude values in the default case are limited to the [-180, 180) range. Example; 'POLYGON ((40.26 -111.29, 41.26 -111.29, 41.26 -110.29, 40.26 -110.29, 40.26 -111.29))'. Use this to improve the dataset findability through geospatial search.
