=== NetCDF-CF datasets

==== Workflow

. Define your dataset (see <<glossary-dataset,Dataset>>)
. Create a netCDF-CF file (see, e.g., link:https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/[netCDF4-python docs], or link:http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/user-guide/io.html[xarray docs])

  * Add discovery metadata as global attributes (see <<acdd-elements,global attibutes section>>)
  * Add variables and <<glossary-use-metadata,use metadata>> following the link:https://cfconventions.org/[CF conventions]

. Test that your dataset contains the necessary discovery metadata and create MMD xml file(s) (see <<test-and-create-mmd-file>>)
. Store the file in a suitable location, and distribute it via thredds or another dap server (see, e.g., <<add-to-thredds>>)
. Index your data in a searchable metadata catalog under a development environment
. Verify that the development CSW service works as expected (e.g., that it provides correct metadata)
. Index your data in a staging/production environment

The data producer should be able to handle points 1-5, whereas the last four points (6-9) should be done with help from a system expert.
