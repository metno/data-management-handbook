=== Submitting data as NetCDF-CF

==== Workflow

. Define your dataset (see <<glossary-dataset,Dataset>>)
. Create a netCDF-CF file (see <<data-as-netcdf-cf>>)

  * Add discovery metadata as global attributes (see <<acdd-elements,global attibutes section>>)
  * Add variables and <<glossary-use-metadata,use metadata>> following the link:https://cfconventions.org/[CF conventions]

. Store the file in a suitable location, and distribute it via thredds or another dap server (see, e.g., <<add-to-thredds>>)
. Test that your dataset contains the necessary discovery metadata and create MMD xml file(s) (see <<test-and-create-mmd-file>>)
. Index your data in a searchable metadata catalog under a development environment
. Verify that the development CSW service works as expected (e.g., that it provides correct metadata)
. Index your data in a staging/production environment

The data producer should be able to handle points 1-4, whereas the last four points (5-7) should be done with help from a system expert.
