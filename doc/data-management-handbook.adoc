== Abstract

This document describes data management practises, and focuses on the management and sharing of the data that are created by this institute. The practises are based on the FAIR principles and aim at a metadata-driven data management regime. The institute’s data and management principles are described and summarised. Details of the practical implementation of the principles are described along 4 pillars: structuring and documenting data; data services; user portals and documentation; and data governance. Practical guidance for data handlers is also provided.

This document is based on a template shared with several other institutions.
